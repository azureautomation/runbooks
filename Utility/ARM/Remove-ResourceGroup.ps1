<#  
.SYNOPSIS  
  Connects to Azure and removes resource groups that match the name filter 
  
.DESCRIPTION  
  This runbook connects to Azure and removes resource groups with names that have substrings that match the name filter.
  All of the resources in each resource group are also removed.
  An important option is to run in preview mode to see which resource groups and resources will be removed without actually removing them.
  The Azure subscription that is assumed is the subscription that contains the Automation account that is running this runbook.
  The runbook will NOT remove the resource group that contains the Automation account that is running this runbook.
  
  REQUIRED AUTOMATION ASSETS 
     An Automation connection asset that contains the Azure service principal, by default named AzureRunAsConnection. 
  
.PARAMETER NameFilter  
  Required  
  Allows you to specify a name filter to limit the resource groups that you will remove. 
  Pass multiple name filters through a comma separated list.      
  The filter is not case sensitive and will match any resource group that contains the string.    
  
.PARAMETER PreviewMode  
  Optional, with default of $true (preview mode is on by default).  
  Execute the runbook to see which resource groups would be deleted but take no action.
  Run the runbook in preview mode first to see which resource groups would be removed.
